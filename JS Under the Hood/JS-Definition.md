# JavaScript

ðŸŽ¯*Javascript is a High-Level, Prototype-Based Object Oriented, Multi-Paradigm, Interpreted or Just-In-Time(JIT) Compiled, Single-Threaded, Garbage-Collected, Dynamic Programming Language with First-class functions and a Non-Blocking Event Loop Concurrency Model.*

**High-Level:**

**Prototype-Based Object Oriented:**

**Multi-Paradigm:** An approach and mindset of structuring code, which will direct your coding style and technique. There 3 paradigms:  
    1. Procedural Programming.  
    2. Object-oriented Programming.  
    3. Functional Programming.  

**Interpreted or Just-in-time Compiled:**

**Single Threaded:** JS runs in one single thread, so it can do only one thing at a time.

**Garbage Collected:**

**Dynamic Language:** We don't assign data-types to any variable. It became known to the JS engine when it executes the code. Also data-types of variable can be changed easily based on the values assign to it. However there is a keyword `const` which makes the variable immutable.

**First-class Functions:** In a language with first class functions; functions are treated as variables. We can pass them into other functions and return them from functions.

**Non-Blocking Event Loop:** Concurrency model is the procedure by which JS engine handles multiple tasks happening at the same time.

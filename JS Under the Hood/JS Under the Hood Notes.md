# JavaScript Under the hood

ðŸŽ¯*Javascript is a High-Level, Prototype-Based Object Oriented, Multi-Paradigm, Interpreted or Just-In-Time(JIT) Compiled, Single-Threaded, Garbage-Collected, Dynamic Programming Language with First-class functions and a Non-Blocking Event Loop Concurrency Model.*

**High-Level:**

**Prototype-Based Object Oriented:**

**Multi-Paradigm:** An approach and mindset of structuring code, which will direct your coding style and technique. There 3 paradigms:  
    1. Procedural Programming.  
    2. Object-oriented Programming.  
    3. Functional Programming.  

**Interpreted or Just-in-time Compiled:**

**Single Threaded:**

**Garbage Collected:**

**Dynamic Language:**

**First-class Functions:** In a language with first class functions; functions are treated as variables. We can pass them into other functions and return them from functions.

**Non-Blocking Event Loop:**

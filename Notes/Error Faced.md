## How to Fix the “Cannot read property ‘addEventListener’ of null” Error in JavaScript

The “cannot read property ‘addEventListener’ of null” error occurs in JavaScript when you try to call the addEventListener() method on an element that cannot be found in the DOM. This happens for two main reasons:

1. Accessing the addEventListener() method on an element absent from the DOM.
2. Inserting the script tag referencing the JavaScript file at a point above the declaration of the DOM element in the HTML.

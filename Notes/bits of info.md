# Bits of info

- Always add JS script at the end of the html elements, because our browser parses the HTML from top down. Thus if we add JS script in the `head` tag or in the `body` tag then the browser might spend some extra time parsing the JS code, which can lead to bad user experience.

- Always declare JavaScript variables with `var`,`let`, or `const`. The `var` keyword is used in all JavaScript code from `1995 to 2015`. The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015. If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var.

## Different types of use of equals to sign:- ðŸ§¨ðŸ§¨

- Equal to (`=`) is an assignment operator, which sets the variable on the left of the = to the value of the expression that is on its right. This operator assigns left hand value to right hand value. For example, Writing a=10 is fine. If we write 10=10, â€˜aâ€™ = 10 or â€˜aâ€™ = â€˜aâ€™, it will result in a reference error.

- `==` only checks the values of the comparison regardless of their datatype. But `===` checks the values as well as the datatypes of the variable.

    ```Javascript
    let var_x = 10;  // Assignment
    let str_x = "10";

    console.log(var_x == str_x);  // >> True
    console.log(var_x === str_x);  // >> False
    ```

## Semi-colons ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

- In JavaScript, semicolons are optional. which means

    ```Javascript
    // Both statements work the same way
    console.log("Hello")
    console.log("Hello");
    ```

    How ever in `for loops` we need to use a (`;`).

    ```Javascript
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        console.log(numbers[i]);
    }
    ```

- **Optional use of `;`**:

    ```Javascript
    let i;                        // variable declaration
    i = 5;                        // value assignment
    let x = 9;                    // declaration and assignment
    var fun = function() {...};   // function definition
    alert("hi");                  // function call
    ```

## Automatic Semi-colon insertion in JavaScript

- JavaScript is clever and it can add the semicolons where needed automatically. This happens behind the scenes and you will not notice it. This process is called `Automatic Semicolon Insertion(ASI)`.

## Awkward features

- "1" and 2 can be added(*concatenated*) to form a string. ðŸ˜¨

```JS
console.log(1+2);  // Integer value: 3
console.log("1" + 2);  // Output is a concatenated string: "12", Here "1" is a string and 2 is a number resulting a string "12".
```

## First-class Function

- A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

    ```js
    const foo = (param) => {
        console.log(`foobar, param is ${param}`);
    };

    foo(10); // Invoke it using the variable
    ```

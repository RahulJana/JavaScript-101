# Strings

---

-   Strings are primitives.
-   As we already know primitives does not have methods. Only objects can have methods. But String has many methods.
-   Reason: JS converts String primitives into string objects, using `boxing`(Putting strings inside an string object[Box]). Thus calling it boxing.
